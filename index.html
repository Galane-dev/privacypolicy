  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Date of last revision:</strong> September 28, 2025</p>
  <p>This Privacy Policy (hereinafter referred to as the "Policy") governs the collection, use, storage, disclosure, and protection of information in connection with the Simple Study, Study Surge: Grade 12 All Subjects, Bestro, Bestro Service Provider, Grade 12 Life Sciences A+, Unihub, and [New App Name] mobile applications (collectively referred to as the "Applications"), developed and operated by Galane (hereinafter referred to as the "Service Provider"). By accessing or using the Applications, you expressly acknowledge and agree to be bound by the terms of this Policy, as may be amended from time to time. The Applications are provided on an "as-is" and "as-available" basis as advertisement-supported services with in-app purchases of credits for accessing digital goods. If you do not agree to the terms herein, you must immediately cease use of the Applications.</p>

  <h2>1. Information Collection and Use</h2>
  <p>The Service Provider collects, processes, and stores a wide array of personal and non-personal information from users of the Applications to facilitate the delivery, maintenance, and enhancement of its services. Information collected includes, but is not limited to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, device identifiers, and other unique identifiers associated with the user's device;</li>
    <li>Navigation data, including pages accessed within the Applications, timestamps, duration of visits, and interaction patterns;</li>
    <li>Device-specific information, such as operating system version, device model, and unique device identifiers;</li>
    <li>Approximate geolocation data derived from IP addresses, GPS, Wi-Fi networks, or cellular data, where permitted by user settings;</li>
    <li>Usage analytics, including frequency, duration, and patterns of Application use;</li>
    <li>Any additional information voluntarily provided by users during interaction with the Applications, such as preferences or feedback.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The foregoing information is utilized for, but not limited to, the following purposes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Delivering personalized content, recommendations, and user experiences tailored to individual preferences;</li>
    <li>Conducting aggregated data analytics to evaluate usage trends, enhance Application performance, and optimize functionality;</li>
    <li>Facilitating targeted advertising through third-party platforms, subject to applicable laws and user consent;</li>
    <li>Ensuring compliance with legal and regulatory obligations, including fraud prevention and security monitoring;</li>
    <li>Sharing anonymized and aggregated data with third-party service providers to enhance Application functionality and user experience.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Failure to provide certain information may limit or impair the functionality of the Applications or the user's ability to access certain features.</p>

  <h2>2. Third-Party Data Sharing and Services</h2>
  <p>The Service Provider engages third-party service providers to perform functions such as analytics, advertising, crash reporting, and performance optimization. These third parties may collect and process data under their own privacy policies, which may differ from this Policy. Users are strongly encouraged to review the privacy policies of the following third-party services integrated into the Applications:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/">Google Play Services</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://support.google.com/admob/answer/6128543?hl=en">AdMob</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy">Google Analytics for Firebase</a></li>

    <li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/update/printable">Facebook</a></li>
  </ul>
  <p>The Service Provider may share anonymized, aggregated, or otherwise de-identified data with third parties for purposes including, but not limited to, market research, service improvement, and advertising optimization. Such sharing is conducted in compliance with applicable data protection laws, but the Service Provider cannot guarantee the practices of third parties beyond the scope of this Policy.</p>

  <h2>3. Cookies and Tracking Technologies</h2>
  <p>The Applications may employ cookies, web beacons, pixel tags, and other tracking technologies to collect and store information about user interactions. These technologies may track user behavior across devices and over time, including interactions with advertisements and third-party content. Users may manage cookie preferences through their device or browser settings; however, disabling these technologies may impair Application functionality.</p>

  <h2>4. Opt-Out Rights</h2>
  <p>Users may opt out of data collection by uninstalling the Applications through the standard uninstall procedures provided by their mobile device or app marketplace. Additionally, users may adjust device settings to limit certain data collection, such as geolocation or advertising identifiers, though such actions may reduce the functionality or availability of certain Application features.</p>

  <h2>5. Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
  <p>The Service Provider retains collected data for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Policy, comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce agreements. Data may be retained in anonymized or aggregated form indefinitely for analytical purposes. Users may request deletion of their personal data by submitting a written request to <a href="mailto:welcomegalane@gmail.com">welcomegalane@gmail.com</a>. Such requests will be processed within a reasonable timeframe, subject to legal and operational requirements. Deletion of data may not be instantaneous and residual copies may remain in backup systems for a limited period.</p>
  <p>In cases involving minors, parents or legal guardians may request the deletion of any unauthorized data by contacting <a href="mailto:welcomegalane@gmail.com">welcomegalane@gmail.com</a>. The Service Provider reserves the right to verify the identity and authority of individuals making such requests.</p>

  <h2>6. Data Security</h2>
  <p>The Service Provider implements reasonable physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect user data from unauthorized access, use, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. However, no method of data transmission or storage is entirely secure, and the Service Provider cannot guarantee absolute security. Users assume the risk of any unauthorized access or breach to the extent permitted by law.</p>

  <h2>7. International Data Transfers</h2>
  <p>User data may be transferred to, stored, and processed in jurisdictions other than the user’s country of residence, including jurisdictions that may not provide equivalent data protection standards. By using the Applications, users explicitly consent to such international data transfers and acknowledge the associated risks.</p>

  <h2>8. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>The Applications are not intended for use by individuals under the age of 13 without parental consent. The Service Provider does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If the Service Provider becomes aware of unauthorized data collection from a minor, it will take reasonable steps to delete such data. Parents or guardians may contact <a href="mailto:welcomegalane@gmail.com">welcomegalane@gmail.com</a> to address concerns regarding minors’ data.</p>

  <h2>9. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>The Service Provider reserves the right to modify or amend this Policy at its sole discretion. Significant changes will be communicated through updates to this page or, where required by law, through direct notification to users. Continued use of the Applications following such changes constitutes acceptance of the revised Policy. Users are responsible for regularly reviewing this Policy to stay informed of any updates.</p>

  <h2>10. User Consent</h2>
  <p>By downloading, installing, or using the Applications, you expressly consent to the collection, processing, storage, and disclosure of your information as described in this Policy, including any future amendments. You further acknowledge that you have read and understood the terms of this Policy and agree to be bound by them.</p>

  <h2>11. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution</h2>
  <p>This Policy shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction in which the Service Provider is domiciled, without regard to conflict of law principles. Any disputes arising under or in connection with this Policy shall be resolved through binding arbitration in accordance with the rules of a recognized arbitration authority, unless otherwise required by applicable law.</p>

  <h2>12. Refund and Cancellation Policy</h2>
  <p>The Service Provider is committed to ensuring customer satisfaction with its in-app credit purchases for accessing digital goods provided through the Applications. This Refund and Cancellation Policy outlines the procedures for purchases and dispute resolution. All requests must be submitted in writing to <a href="mailto:welcomegalane@gmail.com">welcomegalane@gmail.com</a>, and the Service Provider reserves the right to verify the requester's identity before processing.</p>
  <p><strong>In-App Credit Purchases:</strong> Users may purchase credits within the Applications to access digital goods, such as premium content or features. These credits are non-transferable, non-redeemable for cash, and can only be used within the specific Application where they were purchased.</p>
  <p><strong>Refunds:</strong> Due to the nature of digital goods and in-app credits, which are delivered instantly upon purchase and cannot be returned or revoked once accessed, the Service Provider maintains a strict no-refunded policy. This approach ensures the sustainability of our service model, allowing us to maintain high-quality content, continuous updates, and operational stability for all users. Exceptions may be considered solely for cases involving duplicate charges or billing errors, subject to verification. Such requests must be submitted within 48 hours of the transaction. Transaction fees charged by payment processors (e.g., Paystack) are non-refunded. Users are encouraged to review platform-specific policies for purchases made through app stores (e.g., Google Play or Apple App Store).</p>
  <p><strong>Dispute Resolution:</strong> If a user is unhappy with their purchase and wishes to dispute a charge, they should first contact the Service Provider at <a href="mailto:welcomegalane@gmail.com">welcomegalane@gmail.com</a> to attempt resolution. The Service Provider will investigate the matter promptly and respond within 5 business days. If no resolution is reached, disputes may be escalated to the relevant payment processor (e.g., Paystack) or app store, where applicable policies will govern. In the event of chargebacks or disputes raised with the user's bank, the Service Provider will respond in accordance with processor requirements, providing evidence of service delivery where appropriate. The Service Provider's liability is limited to the amount paid for the in-app credits in question.</p>
  <p>This policy complies with applicable consumer protection laws and payment processor guidelines. Users are encouraged to review platform-specific policies for purchases made through app stores.</p>

  <p><strong>Email:</strong> <a href="mailto:welcomegalane@gmail.com">welcomegalane@gmail.com</a></p>
