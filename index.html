  <h2>1. Information Collection and Use</h2>
  <p>The Service Provider collects, processes, analyzes, stores, and utilizes a comprehensive array of personal and non-personal information from users of the Applications to facilitate the delivery, maintenance, enhancement, and monetization of its services.

    <li>Conducting aggregated and individualized data analytics to evaluate usage trends, enhance Application performance, optimize functionality, and develop new features;</li>
    <li>Facilitating targeted advertising through third-party platforms, including behavioral advertising, contextual advertising, and retargeting campaigns;</li>

    <li>Sharing anonymized, pseudonymized, and aggregated data with third-party service providers, advertisers, and business partners to enhance Application functionality and user experience;</li>
    <li>Developing machine learning models and artificial intelligence systems to improve service delivery and user engagement;</li>
    <li>Creating comprehensive user profiles for marketing, analytics, and service personalization purposes.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Failure to provide certain information may result in complete or partial limitation of Application functionality, restricted access to features, or termination of service at the sole discretion of the Service Provider.</p>

  <h2>2. Third-Party Data Sharing and Services</h2>
  <p>The Service Provider engages extensively with third-party service providers, advertising networks, analytics companies, and business partners to perform functions including but not limited to analytics, advertising, crash reporting, performance optimization, payment processing, and infrastructure support. These third parties may collect, process, store, and utilize data under their own policies, terms, and conditions, which may differ substantially from this Policy. The Service Provider explicitly disclaims any responsibility or liability for the data practices of these third parties.</p>
  <p>Users are strongly encouraged to review the policies of the following third-party services integrated into the Applications:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/">Google Play Services</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://support.google.com/admob/answer/6128543?hl=en">AdMob</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy">Google Analytics for Firebase</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy/">Firebase Crashlytics</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/update/printable">Facebook</a></li>
    <li>Additional third-party services not explicitly listed herein may be integrated at the Service Provider's discretion.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The Service Provider may share anonymized, aggregated, pseudonymized, or personally identifiable data with third parties for purposes including, but not limited to, market research, service improvement, advertising optimization, business intelligence, and commercial partnerships. Such sharing is conducted in compliance with applicable data protection laws to the extent required, but the Service Provider cannot and does not guarantee the data practices or security measures of third parties beyond the scope of this Policy.</p>
  <p>By using the Applications, you expressly consent to such third-party data sharing and acknowledge that the Service Provider shall not be held liable for any misuse, unauthorized access, or security breaches occurring through third-party services.</p>

  <h2>3. Cookies and Tracking Technologies</h2>
  <p>The Applications employ cookies, web beacons, pixel tags, local storage, session storage, device fingerprinting, and other tracking technologies to collect and store comprehensive information about user interactions, preferences, and behavior. These technologies may track user behavior across devices, applications, websites, and over extended time periods, including detailed interactions with advertisements, third-party content, and Application features.</p>
  <p>Users may manage cookie preferences through their device or browser settings; however, disabling these technologies will likely impair Application functionality, restrict access to features, and may result in termination of service. The Service Provider reserves the right to limit or deny access to users who disable tracking technologies.</p>

  <h2>4. Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
  <p>The Service Provider retains collected data for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Policy, comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, enforce agreements, and support business operations. Data may be retained in identifiable, anonymized, or aggregated form indefinitely for analytical, commercial, and archival purposes.</p>
  <p>Users may request deletion of their personal data by submitting a formal written request to <a href="mailto:welcomegalane@gmail.com">welcomegalane@gmail.com</a>. Such requests will be processed within a reasonable timeframe, subject to legal, regulatory, and operational requirements. The Service Provider reserves the right to deny deletion requests that conflict with legal obligations, ongoing investigations, or business necessities. Deletion of data may not be instantaneous, and residual copies may remain in active systems, backup systems, and archives for extended periods as determined by the Service Provider.</p>
  <p>In cases involving minors, parents or legal guardians may request the deletion of any unauthorized data by contacting <a href="mailto:welcomegalane@gmail.com">welcomegalane@gmail.com</a>. The Service Provider reserves the right to verify the identity, parental status, and authority of individuals making such requests through means deemed appropriate by the Service Provider.</p>

  <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
  <p>The Service Provider implements reasonable physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect user data from unauthorized access, use, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. These measures include, but are not limited to, encryption, access controls, secure network architecture, and regular security assessments.</p>
  <p>However, no method of data transmission or storage is entirely secure, and the Service Provider explicitly disclaims any guarantee of absolute security. Users assume all risks associated with data transmission, storage, and potential unauthorized access to the fullest extent permitted by law. In the event of a security breach, the Service Provider will comply with applicable legal notification requirements but shall not be held liable for any damages resulting from such breach.</p>

  <h2>6. International Data Transfers</h2>
  <p>User data may be transferred to, stored, and processed in jurisdictions other than the user's country of residence, including jurisdictions that may not provide equivalent data protection standards. These jurisdictions may include, but are not limited to, the United States, European Union member states, and other countries where the Service Provider's affiliates, subsidiaries, or service providers maintain facilities.</p>
  <p>By using the Applications, users explicitly and irrevocably consent to such international data transfers and acknowledge the associated risks, including potential access by foreign governments and security agencies under applicable laws of those jurisdictions.</p>

  <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
  <p>The Applications are not intended for use by individuals under the age of 13 without explicit parental consent. The Service Provider does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 without verified parental consent. If the Service Provider becomes aware of unauthorized data collection from a minor, it will take reasonable steps to delete such data in accordance with applicable law.</p>
  <p>Parents or guardians may contact <a href="mailto:welcomegalane@gmail.com">welcomegalane@gmail.com</a> to address concerns regarding minors' data. The Service Provider reserves the right to require satisfactory proof of parental/guardian relationship before processing any requests related to minor's data.</p>

  <h2>8. User Responsibilities and Acceptable Use</h2>
  <p>Users are solely responsible for all activities conducted through their account and device. Prohibited activities include, but are not limited to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Reverse engineering, decompiling, or disassembling the Applications;</li>
    <li>Attempting to circumvent technological protection measures;</li>
    <li>Using the Applications for any illegal, fraudulent, or unauthorized purpose;</li>
    <li>Interfering with or disrupting the integrity or performance of the Applications;</li>
    <li>Collecting or harvesting any information from the Applications through automated means;</li>
    <li>Engaging in any activity that imposes an unreasonable load on the Service Provider's infrastructure.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Violation of these terms may result in immediate termination of access, legal action, and reporting to appropriate authorities.</p>

  <h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>The Service Provider reserves the unilateral right to modify, amend, or replace this Policy at its sole discretion, at any time, and without prior notice. Significant changes may be communicated through updates to this page or, where required by law, through direct notification to users.</p>
  <p>Continued use of the Applications following such changes constitutes irrevocable acceptance of the revised Policy. Users are solely responsible for regularly reviewing this Policy to stay informed of any updates. The Service Provider is under no obligation to notify users of changes beyond what is legally required.</p>

  <h2>10. User Consent</h2>
  <p>By downloading, installing, accessing, or using the Applications, you expressly, knowingly, and voluntarily consent to the collection, processing, storage, transfer, and disclosure of your information as described in this Policy, including any future amendments. You further acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by all terms of this Policy without reservation.</p>
  <p>This consent extends to all data processing activities described herein, including those that may occur after termination of your use of the Applications, to the extent permitted by law.</p>

  <h2>11. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution</h2>
  <p>This Policy shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction in which the Service Provider is domiciled, without regard to conflict of law principles. Any disputes arising under or in connection with this Policy shall be resolved exclusively through binding arbitration in accordance with the rules of a recognized arbitration authority, unless otherwise required by applicable law.</p>
  <p>Users expressly waive any right to participate in class actions, collective actions, or representative actions against the Service Provider. Arbitration shall be conducted on an individual basis only, and the arbitrator's decision shall be final and binding. Users agree to bear their own costs associated with any dispute resolution proceedings.</p>

  <h2>12. Refund and Cancellation Policy</h2>
  <p>The Service Provider is committed to ensuring customer satisfaction with its in-app credit purchases for accessing digital goods provided through the Applications. This Refund and Cancellation Policy outlines the procedures for purchases and dispute resolution. All requests must be submitted in writing to <a href="mailto:welcomegalane@gmail.com">welcomegalane@gmail.com</a>, and the Service Provider reserves the right to verify the requester's identity before processing.</p>
  <p><strong>In-App Credit Purchases:</strong> Users may purchase credits within the Applications to access digital goods, such as premium content or features. These credits are non-transferable, non-redeemable for cash, and can only be used within the specific Application where they were purchased.</p>
  <p><strong>Refunds:</strong> Due to the nature of digital goods and in-app credits, which are delivered instantly upon purchase and cannot be returned or revoked once accessed, the Service Provider maintains a strict no-refund policy. This approach ensures the sustainability of our service model, allowing us to maintain high-quality content, continuous updates, and operational stability for all users. Exceptions may be considered solely for cases involving duplicate charges or billing errors, subject to verification. Such requests must be submitted within 48 hours of the transaction. Transaction fees charged by payment processors (e.g., yoco) are non-refundable. Users are encouraged to review platform-specific policies for purchases made through app stores (e.g., Google Play or Apple App Store).</p>
  <p><strong>Dispute Resolution:</strong> If a user is unhappy with their purchase and wishes to dispute a charge, they should first contact the Service Provider at <a href="mailto:welcomegalane@gmail.com">welcomegalane@gmail.com</a> to attempt resolution. The Service Provider will investigate the matter promptly and respond within 5 business days. If no resolution is reached, disputes may be escalated to the relevant payment processor (e.g., yoco) or app store, where applicable policies will govern. In the event of chargebacks or disputes raised with the user's bank, the Service Provider will respond in accordance with processor requirements, providing evidence of service delivery where appropriate. The Service Provider's liability is strictly limited to the amount paid for the in-app credits in question.</p>

  <h2>13. Limitation of Liability</h2>
  <p>To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the Service Provider shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, including but not limited to loss of profits, data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Your access to or use of or inability to access or use the Applications;</li>
    <li>Any conduct or content of any third party on the Applications;</li>
    <li>Any content obtained from the Applications; and</li>
    <li>Unauthorized access, use, or alteration of your transmissions or content.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The Service Provider's total cumulative liability in connection with this Policy and the Applications shall not exceed the amount paid by you to the Service Provider, if any, in the six months preceding the event giving rise to the claim.</p>

  <h2>14. Indemnification</h2>
  <p>You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless the Service Provider, its affiliates, licensors, and service providers, and its and their respective officers, directors, employees, contractors, agents, licensors, suppliers, successors, and assigns from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, judgments, awards, losses, costs, expenses, or fees (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of or relating to your violation of this Policy or your use of the Applications.</p>

  <h2>15. Termination</h2>
  <p>The Service Provider reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to terminate or suspend your access to the Applications at any time, with or without notice, for any reason, including but not limited to violation of this Policy. Upon termination, your right to use the Applications will cease immediately, and the Service Provider may permanently delete your data in accordance with its data retention policies.</p>

  <h2>16. Severability</h2>
  <p>If any provision of this Policy is held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, such provision shall be deemed modified to the extent necessary to make it valid, legal, and enforceable, and the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect.</p>

  <h2>17. Contact Information</h2>
  <p>For inquiries, complaints, or requests regarding this Policy or the Service Provider's data practices, please contact:</p>
  <p><strong>Email:</strong> <a href="mailto:welcomegalane@gmail.com">welcomegalane@gmail.com</a></p>
